#Client side Autonomous Drone Interoperability code

Server-side code is at https://github.com/auvsi-suas/interop 

Task 1:
  
    -Send telemetry data via Mission planner to interoperability network at 10Hz
    
    -Verify that data on AP can be genrated at 10Hz
    
Task 2 (secondary):
  
    -Imaging sent over interop (not via Mission planner) (don't worry about this)
